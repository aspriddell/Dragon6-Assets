[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dragonfruitnetwork/Dragon6-Assets.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dragonfruitnetwork/Dragon6-Assets)

This repo contains the assets used by the Dragon6 Website and Mobile apps. It is auto pushed to Firebase on commit

Want to host your own? Clone the repo, create a firebase project and set the name in the `.travis.yml` or `.gitlab-ci.yml` then get a firebase token and turn it to base64 and store it as `B64_FIREBASE_TOKEN`. Every time you make an edit to the master branch, your hosting will update.
